# Automobile-Sales-and-Economic-Trends-Development

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing automobile sales trends and exploring the relationship between sales and various economic factors such as recession periods, GDP, unemployment rates, and advertising expenditures. It utilizes multiple data visualization techniques and creates an interactive dashboard to provide an insightful and comprehensive view of the data.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: To handle and manipulate large datasets efficiently.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations such as line charts, scatter plots, and pie charts.
- **Seaborn**: To generate more advanced and aesthetically appealing visualizations such as multi-line plots.
- **Dash (Plotly)**: For creating an interactive dashboard.
- **Plotly Express**: For generating interactive, dynamic plots within the dashboard.

## Key Features and Visualizations

### 1. Yearly Automobile Sales Fluctuation (Line Chart)
- **Objective**: To visualize the fluctuations in total automobile sales across different years. This provides a high-level overview of the overall sales trends over time.

### 2. Sales Trends by Vehicle Type During Recession (Multi-line Plot)
- **Objective**: This plot analyzes how different types of vehicles performed during recession periods. It helps in identifying which types of vehicles were more or less affected by economic downturns.

### 3. Sales Comparison: Recession vs Non-Recession (Seaborn Plot)
- **Objective**: To compare the sales performance of various vehicle types during both recession and non-recession periods. This visualization gives a better understanding of the impact of economic cycles on vehicle sales.

### 4. GDP Analysis: Recession vs Non-Recession (Subplots)
- **Objective**: To compare GDP fluctuations during recession and non-recession periods. This analysis highlights the relationship between GDP and the automobile market during different economic conditions.

### 5. Impact of Seasonality on Sales (Bubble Plot)
- **Objective**: This visualization explores the effect of seasonality on automobile sales. By representing seasonality using bubble size, the visualization provides insights into how certain months or seasons influence sales figures.

### 6. Price vs Sales Volume Correlation (Scatter Plot)
- **Objective**: To determine the correlation between the average vehicle price and the sales volume during recession periods. This analysis provides insights into how pricing strategies could influence demand during economic downturns.

### 7. Advertising Expenditure: Recession vs Non-Recession (Pie Chart)
- **Objective**: To visualize the distribution of advertising expenditure during recession and non-recession periods. This helps to understand the shifts in marketing strategies during economic slowdowns.

### 8. Advertisement Expenditure by Vehicle Type During Recession (Pie Chart)
- **Objective**: This chart shows the proportion of advertising spend allocated to different vehicle types during a recession, offering insights into which types of vehicles received more promotional focus during tough economic times.

### 9. Unemployment Rate and Sales Analysis (Line Plot)
- **Objective**: To analyze how unemployment rates impacted automobile sales during recession periods. This plot provides insights into how economic hardship correlates with consumer purchasing behavior.

## Interactive Dashboard Development

### Features
- The interactive dashboard is built using **Dash (Plotly)** and allows users to explore automobile sales data dynamically.
- Users can filter data by selecting specific vehicle types through a dropdown menu, which updates the visualizations in real-time.
- The dashboard visualizes the sales trends for each selected vehicle type over time, providing a flexible and user-friendly way to analyze sales data.

### Dashboard Capabilities
- **Dropdown Menu**: Allows users to select vehicle types of interest, updating the graph based on the selection.
- **Dynamic Graph**: Displays sales trends for the chosen vehicle types, offering an interactive way to analyze the data.

## Conclusion
Through this project, I have successfully analyzed automobile sales data, focusing particularly on trends during recession periods. The visualizations provide valuable insights into the relationship between economic indicators like GDP, unemployment rates, and advertising expenditure with automobile sales. The interactive dashboard further enhances the analysis by allowing users to dynamically filter and explore the data. This combination of static and interactive visualizations helps to better understand the complexities of the automobile market under varying economic conditions.
